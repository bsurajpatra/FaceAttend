# FaceAttend – Face Recognition Attendance System

FaceAttend is a modern attendance management solution designed for educational institutions. The app leverages advanced face recognition technology to automatically identify and mark student attendance, eliminating the need for manual roll calls and preventing proxy attendance. With its intuitive mobile interface and secure kiosk mode, FaceAttend streamlines the attendance process while maintaining data integrity and security.

It consists of:
- A mobile client (React Native + Expo)
- A Node.js/Express backend with MongoDB
- A Python/Flask FaceNet microservice for high-accuracy embeddings

## The Problem
Manual attendance is time-consuming, error-prone, and susceptible to proxy attendance. Institutions need a fast, secure, and contactless solution that integrates with their schedule and generates reliable reports.

## The Solution
FaceAttend captures live frames from a kiosk-mode device, generates a robust FaceNet embedding server-side, matches against enrolled students for the current class session, and updates attendance in real time with clear feedback to the operator.

## 📱 Kiosk Mode for Secure Attendance
FaceAttend is designed specifically for faculty to take classroom attendance using their mobile device. In many classrooms, faculty temporarily hand their phone to a student (or a student representative) to capture attendance. To prevent misuse while the device is out of the instructor's hands, FaceAttend includes a kiosk mode. Kiosk mode restricts access to the device to only the attendance capture flow — it prevents students from opening other apps, accessing device settings, or navigating away from the attendance screen while recording attendance.

## 🚀 Features
- Face recognition attendance with FaceNet embeddings (Python microservice)
- Real-time live camera detection with 0.5s capture loop (silent)
- Student enrollment with face capture and subject/section association
- Faculty dashboard with current-session detection and one-tap "Take Attendance"
- Timetable setup and editing (supports hours 1–24)
- Attendance sessions and detailed reports with location tracking
- Secure kiosk mode for dedicated devices (Android orientation lock, UI blocking, back button handling)
- JWT authentication and protected APIs
- Settings & Profile Management: Camera and location permissions, faculty profile updates, password management
- Advanced Student Management: View, edit, and delete student records with comprehensive filtering and export capabilities
- Export Functionality: PDF and CSV export for student lists and attendance reports with location data
- Duplicate Prevention: Automatic validation for duplicate roll numbers and face descriptors within classes
- Location Tracking: GPS location capture and display for attendance sessions
- Student Attendance Analytics: Individual student attendance percentages and session tracking
- Attendance Status Management: Dashboard acknowledgment of taken attendance with retake functionality
- Flexible Time Management: Support for 24-hour time slots and empty timetable handling

## 🔄 End-to-End Flow
1) Login
- Client: `POST /api/auth/login` → stores JWT in AsyncStorage; axios adds `Authorization` header.

2) Timetable
- Faculty configures sessions (subject, section, type, hours). Server validates `hours` (min 1, max 20).
- Dashboard computes “current session” based on time using `TIME_SLOTS` (now includes hour 12).

3) Student Registration
- Client captures face image (base64) and calls `POST /api/students/register`.
- Server calls Python `/api/recognize`, stores FaceNet embedding on `Student` (`faceDescriptor` legacy + `embeddings` array).

4) Start Attendance
- Client: `POST /api/attendance/start` with subject/section/type/hours.
- Server creates an attendance session with records for enrolled students.

5) Live Attendance
- `live-attendance.tsx` runs a silent frame capture every 0.5–3s and sends base64 frames to `POST /api/attendance/mark`.
- Server requests embedding from Python, matches by cosine similarity vs enrolled students; threshold defaults to 0.6.
- UI shows banners near the Start/Pause button with student ID display:
  - Green: "✅ [Student Name] (ID: [Roll Number]) marked present!"
  - Yellow: "⚠️ [Student Name] (ID: [Roll Number]) already marked"
  - Red: not found/error

6) Reports
- Client queries `GET /api/attendance/reports` and `GET /api/attendance/session/:id` for details.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Tuning

### General Issues
- Face not detected: ensure good lighting, frontal face; Python service logs "No face detected".
- Poor recall: adjust threshold in server (`FACE_MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.6`) and Python MTCNN params.
- Timetable hour 12+ not showing: ensure client `TIME_SLOTS` includes hour, server `hours.max` allows (currently 20).
- Network fallbacks: set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` with multiple URLs (comma-separated) for failover.
- Kiosk overlap: status banners in `live-attendance.tsx` render above/below the Start/Pause button.

### FaceNet Service Issues
1. **"FaceNet service is not running"**: Make sure the Python service is started on port 5001
2. **"No face detected"**: Ensure the uploaded image contains a clear, well-lit face
3. **Import errors**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
4. **Connection refused**: Check if the service is running and accessible at `http://localhost:5001`
5. **Model loading errors**: Ensure all required model files are downloaded and accessible
